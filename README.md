# simpledns

I wanted to make a really basic DNS server for my home network because I am too dumb to use the built-in linux dns servers.

This project was made following [this guide](https://github.com/EmilHernvall/dnsguide/tree/master) but put my own spin on things especially with features I wanted to add or not add.

# Ideas

- [x] custom records for computers on my home server
- [x] pi-hole-like "dropping" of names
- [ ] regex matching for name resolution
- [ ] recursive resolver
- [ ] in-memory and file-based caching for records that we have found
